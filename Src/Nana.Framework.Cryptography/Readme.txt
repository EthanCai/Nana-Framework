关于Hash算法和对称加密算法的选择：

For hashing algorithms, the SHA256Managed algorithm is recommended. This algorithm uses a hash size of 256 bits. The hash size of SHA1Managed hashing algorithm is 160 bits. This algorithm is acceptable but not encouraged. The MD4 and MD5 algorithms are no longer recommended. 

For symmetric algorithms, AES, also known as Rijndael, is recommended. This algorithm supports key lengths of 128, 192, 256 bits. The DES algorithm is not recommended.
